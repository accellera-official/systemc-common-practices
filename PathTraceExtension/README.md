# Path Trace Extension

This extension provides a vector of SystemC objects. The expectation is that each SystemC model will 'stamp' the transaction as it passes through a network.
The extension provides a convenience function to "stamp" the network and to provide a string representation on the completed path.
The extension should be 'cleared' before re-use.
